I personnaly like doing them in python because its easier to ready

#### Day5

I know i splitted my input but im bad with regex...

#### Day6

I dont like regex but i figured how to use it, it gives me a super long string for part two but what can you do

#### day 7

IM SOOOOOO DUMB, i was forgettting to update all the parents folder so i was like about 10000 off... im so annoyed, it took me reddit and 2hrs to figure it out...

#### day 8

##### part one

jeez im stupid, i was forgetting to add all the exterior trees, and remove one character to account for the \n i kept in there as indicator

##### part two

it was way easier the only thing that got me stuck was the fact that i wasnt reseting my values to calculate the scenic score at the right place

#### day 9

i couldnt do it on the day it game out, so yeah taking my chance on day 10

##### part one

for some reason programming it in a OOP way makes sense to me...
ok back at it we gonna try to make it work
WOOOOO we almost there the rope is following the right path i just need to figure out how to count every square the tail moves
AFTER SOOOOOO LONG OF WORKING ON IT IT WORKS
IM GENIOUS AND OOP IS COOL

##### part two

sadly i fucked up and my length parameter do not do its job, so i need to re think the entire thing...
